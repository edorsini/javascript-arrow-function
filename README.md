# JavaScript Arrow Function (ES6)

## Advantages? Disadvantages? What's the big deal?

An arrow function expression has a shorter syntax than a function expression and does not have its own this, arguments, super, or new.target. These function expressions are best suited for non-method functions, and they cannot be used as constructors.

Two factors influenced the introduction of arrow functions: shorter functions and no existence of this keyword.
